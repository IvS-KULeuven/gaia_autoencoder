# Autoencoding *Gaia* DR3 variable sources

This repository will hold the implementation of the models and the training scripts associated with the article "Learning novel representations of variable sources from multi-modal Gaia data via autoencoders" upon acceptance of the manuscript. 

The training dataset can be downloaded from the Gaia Archive using the provided scripts or via direct download through Zenodo. The latent space that reproduces the figures in the paper will be made available via Zenodo.
